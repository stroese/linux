Description:
		This driver implements the Linux kernel half of the
		U-Boot bootcount feature - the boot counter can only
		be reset after it is clear that the application has
		been started and is running correctly, which usually
		can only be determined by the application code itself.
		Thus the reset of the boot counter must be done by
		application code, which thus needs an appropriate driver.
